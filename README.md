# Not-oModerator 

(Scroll down for 'how-to')

Get rid of the AutoMod comment that sits atop so many comment sections wasting everyones time. 

# What is it? 
This is a google chrome extension that removes the "AutoModerator" comment which is permanantly affixed to the top of so many comment sections in order to waste our time consistently. Want to see the top comment? First ignore this lazy inapplicable guidance! Well... no longer.

# Note: 

This is my first chrome extension and a very simple one. I encourage everyone to take a look at the code. It merely identifies an HTML element based on whether it has a class "moderator" and a text of "mod" or "bot". If it meets those criteria: I anhilitate it. No mercy. Enjoy!!

# How to use this: 

Note: this is for users of 'old reddit'. If you don't know what that is I feel sorry for you

1. Click the green button that says "code" that is above this text box, or click [here](https://github.com/purplefloyd14/Not-oModerator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) (if you click here you can ignore step two because download will start automatically). 
2. Select the last item on the list "download zip". 
3. Go to you downloads folder and double click on the zip that was just downloaded. This will create an 'unzipped version' next to it. 
4. Open chrome and go to chrome://extensions/ (put this into the url bar as if it were a website)
5. On the top right of the page, toggle developer mode to 'on'
6. On the top left of the page, click the button that reads "load unpacked"
7. Select the 'unzipped version' of the extension that emerged when you clicked on the zip file that you downloaded from this repo 
8. ta-da! All done. Now go enjoy reddit without the automoderator popping up on every stinkin' page telling you nothing interesting or important
